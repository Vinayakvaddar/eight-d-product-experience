# 8-D Product Experience

A narrative-driven React.js frontend experience designed to showcase the core offerings of 8-D in a modern, immersive way.

Instead of using a traditional grid-based layout, this project presents products as a continuous story using horizontal motion, subtle automation, and clear visual hierarchy.

---

## Objective

Redesign and implement a high-converting, modern UI inspired by https://8-d.ai/, while improving clarity, flow, and engagement.

The focus was on:
- Storytelling over static layouts
- Smooth interactions and micro-animations
- Clean and maintainable React architecture

---

##  Design Philosophy

- **Narrative Flow**: Each product is treated as a chapter in a story.
- **Horizontal Experience**: Products are explored via a continuous horizontal scroll.
- **User Control**: Auto-scroll is supported but never forced.
- **Minimal UI**: No heavy UI libraries, cards, or visual clutter.
- **Clear Separation**: Products, Use Cases, Benefits, Blogs, and Contact are intentionally separated for UX clarity.

---

##  Key Features

- Infinite horizontal product scroll (360° loop)
- Auto-scroll with pause on interaction
- Arrow navigation and progress indicators
- Section-based navigation (`#products`, `#usecase`, `#benefits`, `#blogs`, `#contact`)
- Responsive layout for all screen sizes
- Modular and reusable React components

---

## Tech Stack

- **React.js** (Vite)
